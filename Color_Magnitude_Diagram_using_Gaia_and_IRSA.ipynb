        "#The Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram\n",
        "The famous Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram has many uses in stellar astronomy. An HR diagram shows relationships between stellar populations. This activity focuses on stars that are members of a cluster. Stars in a cluster have a common distance, age, and composition. Suppose you have magnitudes measured using different filters (brightnesses measured over a narrow range of wavelengths) for a group of stars that are known members of the same cluster. In that case, you can make a color-magnitude diagram (CMD). If filters are used to image an object, then comparing the amount of light in each filter can provide an analog for temperature in the optical. Things are different in other bands of the EM spectrum. Since magnitudes are logarithmic, a difference in magnitudes is a ratio of fluxes. See the appendix for a lot more detail. This difference is called a [color index](http://spiff.rit.edu/classes/phys440/lectures/color/color.html) based on [the star Vega](http://spiff.rit.edu/classes/phys440/lectures/color/color.html) (assuming no intervening dust). If the index is negative, the star is bluer than the standard star (Vega). If the index is positive, the star is redder than Vega. You will use actual data from the Gaia mission in the IRSA database to create a CMD for some star clusters.\n",

The filtered data will contain mostly stars that belong to the cluster and not stars that happen to be along our line of sight that are not cluster members. Try limiting the data to values between the given parallax maximum and minimum values if the results say `0.425 [0.002]`, enter the following into the filter cell below `lower = 0.3` and `upper = 0.5`.
