All the energy emitted at that same instant can be thought of as being spread out over surface of a sphere. As this imaginary sphere gets bigger, the light gets more spread out. This is why distance matters when looking at a light source. Note the equation for the surface area of a sphere:\n",

The farther you get from the source, the bigger the sphere must be when it reaches you (larger radius, R) and consequently, the light is spread out more and so the source seems dimmer.\n",

There are many peculiarlities with magnitude. For example a negative magnitude represents a brighter object than does a positive magnitude. Another useful point is that just using light from an image, astronomers can quickly measure the magnitude as seen from earth, the apparent magnitude. That leaves some work to do to get turn the physical brightness or luminosity of the object into the absolute magnitude. The magnitude scale is clunky but still in use - for now."
